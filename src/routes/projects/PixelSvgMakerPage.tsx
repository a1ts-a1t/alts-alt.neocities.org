                <p>While making this website, I&apos;ve been trying to make all my own pixel art icons. In an attempt to keep asset bundle size small while keeping resolution high, I wanted to make all my icons SVGs. (Let&apos;s ignore the fact that having them be icons means that they can be lower resolution and whatever.) Looking online, I had a hard time finding a pixel art engine that let you export to SVG, so I decided to make one on my own.</p>
                <p>This is not meant to be a fully featured pixel art engine by any stretch of the imagination, but it provides just enough functionality for me to at least make my icons way faster than I did before. If it happens to be something that is useful to you, that&apos;s fantastic! If it ends up being so useful to you that you get annoyed at how few features there are, I encourage you to create a feature request on <Link className='text-enabled hover:underline hover:underline-offset-2' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer' to='https://github.com/a1ts-a1t/alts-alt.neocities.org/issues'>github</Link>.</p>
                <p>Happy pixel art-ing!</p>
